### Notes
Issues:
---
- Even when text is selected, the wiki scraper will work taking the last word of the text. [FIXED]
- Delete Note Button is not working.                                                       [FIXED]
---
It might need a tokenizer feature to save space in memory.
---

Complications:
---

Questions:
- It's possible to deploy a model in HuggingFace and then use it in the TextEditor? 
   - Technically yes, I should be able to set the model weights to the values that I want.
    - I would need to find a way to save the model weights in a file and then load it in the TextEditor.
- It's problematic to think about a system like this that automatically fine tuned with the data.

---
Ideas: 

I want to create a graph that represent the connections between the words and the notes in the text.

- The nodes will be the words.
- The edges will be the notes.
- The weight of the edges will be the number of times that the word appears in the note.

Need to set a title to every note.
- I want elasticity, I don't want to have to set the title manually.
- It will be assign automatically, but I want to be able to change it.
- Hierarchy of the text. Set title base on the hierarchy of the text tags -> h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p.
- Title can be obtained from:
    - QA Model -> Question: What is this text about? Answer: "George Washington"
    - Counting most common words ? bad approach

ISSUES:

When changing the model we loose the home_dir variable.
